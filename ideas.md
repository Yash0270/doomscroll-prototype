# Doomscroll Detection App Prototype — Design Brainstorm

## Idea 1: "Digital Zen" — Japanese Wabi-Sabi Minimalism

**Design Movement:** Wabi-Sabi meets digital wellness — embracing imperfection, transience, and the beauty of simplicity.

**Core Principles:** Organic asymmetry; muted earth tones; generous negative space; calming micro-interactions that slow the user down.

**Color Philosophy:** A palette rooted in natural materials — warm stone grays, soft sage greens, muted terracotta, and cream whites. Colors should feel like a deep breath, not a screen. The accent is a single warm amber for calls to action.

**Layout Paradigm:** Vertical scroll with large, breathing sections. An iPhone mockup as the centerpiece, flanked by asymmetric information panels. Content reveals itself slowly as the user scrolls, mirroring the mindful pace the app encourages.

**Signature Elements:** (1) A live, animated "breathing circle" that expands and contracts — the core intervention visualization. (2) A simulated accelerometer waveform that looks like a calm heartbeat when idle and becomes erratic during scrolling.

**Interaction Philosophy:** Interactions should feel deliberate and unhurried. Hover states are slow fades. Clicks produce gentle ripples. The prototype itself should model the mindful behavior it promotes.

**Animation:** Slow, eased-in transitions (500ms+). Elements float into view. The breathing circle uses a sinusoidal ease. The sensor waveform animates continuously.

**Typography System:** Display: "Fraunces" (serif, variable weight) for headings — warm, organic, slightly imperfect. Body: "DM Sans" for body text — clean, geometric, highly readable.

## Idea 2: "Neon Detox" — Cyberpunk Data Visualization

**Design Movement:** Cyberpunk / Sci-Fi Dashboard — a high-tech control center for your digital life.

**Core Principles:** Dark interfaces with neon accents; data-dense visualizations; a sense of monitoring and control; the user is a "hacker" taking back control of their attention.

**Color Philosophy:** Deep charcoal and near-black backgrounds. Neon cyan and electric magenta as primary accents. Data visualizations use a gradient from cool cyan to warm magenta. The palette creates a sense of urgency and technological power.

**Layout Paradigm:** A dashboard-style layout with multiple panels. A large central panel shows the phone simulation, surrounded by smaller panels displaying real-time sensor data, ML model confidence scores, and session history.

**Signature Elements:** (1) A glowing, animated neural network graph that lights up when doomscrolling is detected. (2) Real-time scrolling data charts with neon glow effects.

**Interaction Philosophy:** Snappy, responsive, almost aggressive. Hover states produce immediate glows. Clicks trigger data pulses. The interface feels like a command center.

**Animation:** Fast, sharp transitions. Data elements flicker in. Charts animate with a drawing effect. Neon elements pulse subtly.

**Typography System:** Display: "Space Grotesk" — geometric, futuristic. Body: "JetBrains Mono" for data readouts — monospaced, technical. This pairing creates a clear hierarchy between narrative and data.

## Idea 3: "Soft Focus" — Scandinavian Calm Tech

**Design Movement:** Scandinavian Design / Calm Technology — technology that recedes into the background and respects the user's attention.

**Core Principles:** Extreme clarity; soft, rounded forms; pastel tones with high contrast for readability; the interface should feel like a wellness product, not a tech product.

**Color Philosophy:** A soft, warm off-white background. The primary accent is a calming deep teal. Secondary accents are soft peach and lavender. The palette is inspired by a Nordic spa — clean, warm, and restorative.

**Layout Paradigm:** A single, long-scroll page divided into distinct "chapters." Each chapter tells part of the story: the problem, the solution (motion detection), the ML model, and the intervention. A large, centered iPhone mockup serves as the interactive demo.

**Signature Elements:** (1) Soft, frosted-glass card elements with subtle backdrop blur. (2) A "calm meter" — a horizontal bar that shifts from warm red to cool teal as the intervention takes effect.

**Interaction Philosophy:** Gentle and reassuring. Hover states are soft glows. Transitions are smooth and predictable. Nothing should startle the user.

**Animation:** Smooth, spring-based animations (framer-motion). Elements slide in gently. The calm meter transitions with a satisfying ease. Scroll-triggered reveals are subtle.

**Typography System:** Display: "Outfit" — modern, geometric, friendly. Body: "Source Sans 3" — neutral, highly legible, professional. This pairing feels approachable yet trustworthy.
